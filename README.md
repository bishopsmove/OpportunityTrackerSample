#OpportunityTrackerSample

Currently successfully building at [Qhode](http://www.qhode.com/projects/e5361c6f-4283-4b7e-b350-a1b80070eccc).

The intention for this application is to allow a job searcher (or similar entity-relationship) to track opportunities as a Contact Management System. 
This is a EF5 CodeFirst effort with BreezeJS, KnockoutJS and jQuery/jQuery-UI.

## Quick start

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/bishopsmove/OpportunityTrackerSample.git`
